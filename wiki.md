The Seattle Sounders have been around since 1974 across several different leagues. They started as a [NASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Soccer_League_(1968%E2%80%931984)) team until is league disolved. Then in **2009**, they played their first game in MLS.


## Fight for an MLS Franchise
Seattle has always been a city with many soccer supporters. They would always show up to their games during the NASL and USL games. So during the talks for the first teams of this new *Major League Soccer* league Seattle was always in consideration. However, [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) wanted a very important thing that the Sounders did not have at the time, *a soccer specific* stadium. So they were passed over in 1994, 1996, 2004, and 2006. It was not until 2007 when Paul Allen, Adrian Hanauer, Joe Roth, and Drew Carey made a successful bid to grant the city an MLS franchise.

## Early Years

The Sounders season ticket holders reached 32000 member, which was their record, in their second year in the league. They had made the playoffs every year in the their early season. They were also the first MLS team to beat a Mexican League team in the history of the [CONCACAF](https://www.concacaf.com/) regional tournament. In 2014, they also won their first *Supporters Shield*, which means that they were the best team in the league between the two conferences. In 2015, due to key injuries and suspensions, they ran into a slump in the middle of the season, just squeaking in a playoff spot. Only to lose in the conference final.

## Modern Era and Dynasty

The word dynasty has a powerful implication. However, no other team in MLS has come close to completing what the Sounders have since 2016. Upon the arrival of Brian Schmetzer as the new head coach the team in halfway through the 2016 season due to the team seeing their worst start to season after being half way through only managing 6 wins in 20 games. After he took over, they managed to go on to win 8 of their next 14 games, make the playoffs, and beat Toronto to win their first *MLS Cup*. 2017, they once again made the playoffs and had to face Toronto in the final once again, unfortunately losing 0-2 this time around. In 2018, they lost in the Conference Semi-finals. In 2019, they saw their return to the MLS Cup Final and facing, can you guys who, Toronto, this time beating Toronto 3-1 at home in Seattle. In 2022, Seattle made a historic run in **CONCACAF Champions League**, becoming the first team in MLS history to win that title, in which Mexican Teams had only won since the title came into existence. The Sounders unfortunately that year would miss the playoffs for the first time ever. This 2016 to 2022 run has to go down as the best thing this league has seen in the modern era, and very much deserving of the title, **Dynasty**.
