        <p>The word dynasty has a powerful implication. However, no other team in MLS has come close to completing what the Sounders have since 2016. Upon the arrival of Brian Schmetzer as the new head coach halfway through the 2016 season due to the team seeing their worst start to the season after managing only 6 wins in 20 games. After he took over, they managed to win 8 of their next 14 games, make the playoffs, and beat Toronto to win their first <em>MLS Cup</em>. In 2017, they once again made the playoffs and had to face Toronto in the final once again, unfortunately losing 0-2 this time around. In 2018, they lost in the Conference Semi-finals. In 2019, they saw their return to the MLS Cup Final and facing Toronto, this time beating Toronto <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/2019-mls-cup-seattle-sounders-fc-3-toronto-fc-1">3-1</a> at home in Seattle. In 2022, Seattle made a historic run in <strong>CONCACAF Champions League</strong>, becoming the first team in MLS history to win that title, in which Mexican Teams had only won since the title came into existence. The Sounders, unfortunately, missed the playoffs that year for the first time ever. This 2016 to 2022 run has to go down as the best thing this league has seen in the modern era and very much deserving of the title, <strong>Dynasty</strong>.</p>
