        <p>The Sounders season ticket holders reached 32,000 members, which was their record, in their second year in the league. They had made the playoffs every year in their early seasons. They were also the first MLS team to beat a Mexican League team in the history of the <a href="https://www.concacaf.com/">CONCACAF</a> regional tournament. In 2014, they also won their first <em>Supporters Shield</em>, which means that they were the best team in the league between the two conferences. In 2015, due to key injuries and suspensions, they ran into a slump in the middle of the season, just squeaking into a playoff spot. Only to lose in the Conference Final.
